## Contents

### Webhook Clients
Example implementations of webhook receivers in different programming languages:

- **Node.js**: Complete webhook server with HMAC validation
- **Java**: Spring Boot webhook handler (Planned)
- **Python**: Flask/FastAPI webhook endpoint (Planned)

- **Shell Scripts**: Automated testing workflows
- **Test Data**: Sample payloads and configurations

## Development Purpose

These examples are designed for:

1. **Learning**: Understanding how to integrate with the Screenshot API
2. **Testing**: Validating webhook delivery and API functionality
3. **Development**: Quick setup of local testing environments
4. **Reference**: Best practices for production implementations

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains its own README with specific setup and usage instructions.

## Note

These are **development examples only** - not production-ready code. Review and adapt according to your security and reliability requirements before using in production.
